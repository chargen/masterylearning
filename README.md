# About

This is a software for an e-learning application specifically designed
to target university students with a focus on mathematical content,
in particular (logic and model checking).

We currently already support rendering of mathematical content
through the KATEX library made by the Khan Academy folks.

This application is still under development and not all features have
been implemented yet.
