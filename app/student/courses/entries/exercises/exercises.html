    <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>
        This page currently demonstrates two exercise types: <code>YesNoExercises</code>, which produce a dropdown, with
        a 'Yes' and 'No' answer and <code>MultiAnswerExercises</code>, which produce a list of checkboxes. Simple
        yes-no exercises start out with an empty dropdown selection and are considered answered as soon as the user
        selects an answer from the dropdown. For multi answer exercises the user can tick multiple checkboxes and
        needs to confirm his answer through a button when he is done.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once an exercise has been answered, its answer cannot be changed again. And the answers background changes to
        give visual feedback.
    </p>

    <p class="bg-danger">
        Currently this mock has no user persistence, so the answer is lost when the page is refreshed. In the future this mock will be extended,
        so that the previous answer is stored for in the personal history of the user and loaded when the answer is
        loaded.
