        <h1>Storyboard</h1>
        <p>This is the profile view for the student. It includes information about the student. There will not be an overall
            progress for the student since progress can only be made in the individual lectures and their respective units.
        </p>
        <p>For now we do not include <strong>gamification</strong> elements but they could possibly be added later.
        </p>
        <p>For the student we are showing some data of his profile such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Information about the student, e.g. name, username, avatar icon</li>
            <li>Clicking on "Change avatar" will open a dialog where the user can upload a new avatar icon or select one
            of several predefined icons.</li>
            <li>For the "edit profile" button there are still some open questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Should the user be able to change his full name?</li>
                    <li>Should the user be able to change his Matrikelnumber?</li>
                    <li>Are there any other profile related settings that we might want to let the student edit?</li>
                    <li>Depending on how we decide this, the "edit profile" button could either be removed again, or
                        it could open a dialog where the user can make the respective adjustments to his profile.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Your lectures:</h2>
        <p>Here we show a list of lectures that the student is currently
           attending and how much progress the student has already made.</p>
        <p>If the student is attending a lot of lectures we would only show those in which he was active recently
        (such as in the last three days).</p>
