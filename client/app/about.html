    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
        This application is a master thesis project done at the Technical University of Vienna at the Institute for
        Information Systems in the department <em>"Formal Methods in Systems Engineering"</em>. The application was
        written by <em>Sebastian Geiger</em> and counseled by Andreas Holzer.
    </p>

    <p>
        The goal of this application is to aid students in learning and practicing the knowledge that is taught in
        their courses. Using this application students can read the lecture content and practice the exercises before
        each respective lecture and will thus be better prepared, when they attend the lectures. This allows them to
        use the time during the lecture to deepen their understanding and ask questions, rather then struggling to
        keep up with the speed of the lecturer and hearing previously unknown content.

    <h2>Evaluation and Feedback</h2>

    <p>
        This application is still in its <em>beta</em> phase. I have developed and tested it to my best knowledge,
        but there may still be issues that I am not aware of. Please expect to encounter bugs, broken features or
        other problems and if you do I would be happy to hear about it, so that I can fix these issues.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to evaluate how well this application works in practice we need to find students who would like
        to use this application and who will let us know if the application helped them learning the particular topics.
    </p>

    <p>
        Part of my master thesis will be to collect the students feedback, to aggregate and present these results and
        to draw concluses for further improvements of this application. If you have used this application and
        you did not find it useful, or if you have suggestions on how to improve the application, then please let me
        know.
    </p>
